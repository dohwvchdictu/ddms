     * Two views of one queue: "For Action" and "Pending" split it by what the
     * holding office must do next, while Due Soon / Due Today / Overdue cut the
     * same documents by how much time is left. A document therefore sits in one
     * card of each pair, and each pair sums to the whole queue.
     *
     * A document's deadline is its date created plus the required days of its
     * citizen charter, or of its document type when it has no charter — the same
     * basis the External Requests report already uses, so both screens agree.
     *
     * Scope notes:
     *
     * - Only open documents count. The five cards are about work still owed, and
     *   a Closed document has no action pending and no deadline left to meet, so
     *   it belongs to none of them.
     * - Bundled children are excluded. They are received, forwarded and closed
     *   with their parent bundle, so counting them too would report the same
     *   piece of work twice.
     *
     * System-wide, this covers far too many rows to walk one model at a time, so
     * the database groups them by status, deadline commitment and creation date
     * first. Every document created on the same day under the same commitment
     * shares one deadline, which is why the grouping is lossless — it collapses
     * tens of thousands of rows into a few hundred, and the working-day
     * arithmetic PHP has to do runs once per group instead of once per document.
